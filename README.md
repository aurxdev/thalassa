# Thalassa Project

This project is a 2D mophing application in JS, similar to the Thalassa opening sequence. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rHjw3Y8IMA)  
It allows you to create and visualize morphing between polylines.  
The morphing algorithm means to calculate average of each segment depending on alpha.

* Left click to continue the polyline.
* Click on the arrow to do the morphing.
* You can export JSON code and import it.
